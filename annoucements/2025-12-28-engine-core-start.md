# ANIMA Engine Core Development Has Begun

Development of the **ANIMA Engine Core** has officially started Phase 1.

This marks the beginning of work on the invariant runtime responsible for:

- core reasoning and planning
- seed validation and enforcement
- memory layer coordination
- capability boundaries and execution control
- security, permissions, and auditability

The engine core is being developed separately from public-facing documentation and adapters to ensure that identity safety, memory integrity, and architectural constraints are established correctly from the start.

At this stage:
- the engine repository is not public
- no user-facing builds are available
- development is focused on correctness rather than features

Updates will be shared through this documentation repository as major architectural milestones are reached.

ANIMA is being built deliberately, with long-term trust and continuity as primary goals.

Developer statement:

> "Building the ANIMA Engine Core is a critical step toward realizing a safe, consistent, and trustworthy AI companion. By focusing on foundational architecture first, we ensure that every subsequent feature and capability aligns with our core principles of identity integrity and user autonomy. This careful approach allows us to create a system that users can rely on for years to come. I am excited to lead this effort and look forward to sharing our progress with the community."
