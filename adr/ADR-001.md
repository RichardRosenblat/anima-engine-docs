# ADR-001: Separation of ANIMA Engine and Identity via Seed System

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Deciders:** @Richard Rosenblat
**Context:** Core architecture, product viability, identity safety

---

## Context

ANIMA was initially conceived as a single evolving AI entity combining reasoning, memory, personality, and embodiment. As the system scope expanded (long-lived tasks, multi-adapter input, security constraints, and potential monetization), this monolithic framing introduced risks:

* Tight coupling between personality and core logic
* Difficulty supporting multiple independent instances
* Unclear product boundaries (what is sold vs retained)
* Identity bleed and memory privacy concerns
* Limited ability to support both private usage and public/streaming presence

Additionally, future plans include:

* Selling ANIMA as a **private AI product**
* Operating a **streaming / VTuber incarnation**
* Allowing customization without exposing core internals

These requirements necessitate a clearer architectural separation.

---

## Decision

ANIMA is formally split into two layers:

1. **ANIMA Engine**
2. **ANIMA Identity, instantiated via a Seed system**

The engine is identity-agnostic and invariant across instances.
All personality and behavioral differentiation is introduced through seeds.

---

## Definition

### ANIMA Engine

The engine is a private runtime responsible for:

* Intent understanding and reasoning
* Task planning and long-lived task orchestration
* Memory mechanics (episodic, semantic, narrative)
* Capability discovery, permissioning, and execution
* Security, confirmation flows, and audit logging
* Adapter-agnostic input/output handling

The engine:

* Does not encode personality
* Does not contain hardcoded behavioral tone
* Does not store cross-instance memory
* Enforces all safety and permission boundaries

---

### Seed System

A **Seed** is a declarative configuration used to initialize an ANIMA identity.

A seed MAY define:

* Personality parameters (tone, verbosity, emotional expressiveness)
* Behavioral policies (risk tolerance, uncertainty handling)
* Capability allow/deny lists
* Default interaction style
* Initial self-concept and narrative framing
* Memory decay and promotion policies

A seed MUST NOT include:

* Learned memories
* User data
* Conversation logs
* Private behavior evolution
* Execution logic

Once initialized, an ANIMA instance evolves independently using instance-local memory only.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

* Enables multiple independent ANIMA instances with shared engine logic
* Supports commercialization without distributing source code
* Prevents identity and memory leakage across instances
* Allows a protected “Prime” identity for streaming / VTuber use
* Makes personality fully data-driven and configurable
* Simplifies testing, upgrades, and engine evolution

### Trade-offs

* Requires stricter boundaries between engine and persona
* Increases upfront design complexity (seed schema, validation)
* Limits how much behavior can be “hardcoded” into prompts
* Requires explicit handling of identity evolution and drift

These trade-offs are considered acceptable given the long-term benefits.

---

## Product Implications

This decision enables two aligned use cases:

1. **Private ANIMA Product**

   * Users license the engine runtime
   * Users initialize with a chosen seed
   * Users own their instance’s data and memory
   * Engine source code remains private

2. **Streaming / VTuber ANIMA**

   * Implemented as `ANIMA Engine + Prime Seed`
   * Prime seed is protected IP and never distributed
   * Shares no memory or identity state with customer instances

---

## Constraints Introduced

The following constraints are now architectural invariants:

* The engine must remain persona-agnostic
* Seeds may tune or restrict behavior but cannot extend execution power
* Capability enforcement occurs exclusively at the engine level
* Memory is strictly instance-scoped
* Identity evolution must be explicit and reviewable (no silent drift)

---

## Rationale

This separation reframes ANIMA as a **stable engine for growing identities**, rather than a single monolithic AI personality. It preserves safety, privacy, and long-term flexibility while keeping both private and public-facing incarnations technically aligned.

---

## Future Work

* Define seed schema and versioning strategy
* Implement seed validation and compatibility checks
* Formalize engine upgrade guarantees across seed versions
* Define licensing and capability gating mechanisms
