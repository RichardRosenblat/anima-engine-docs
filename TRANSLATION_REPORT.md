# Translation Coverage Report

**Date**: January 11, 2026  
**Generated by**: Translation Coverage Analysis Tool

---

## Executive Summary

The ANIMA Engine documentation currently supports **2 languages** in addition to English:
- **Portuguese (Brazil)** - `pt-br/`
- **Spanish (Mexico)** - `es-mx/`

### Overall Coverage Statistics

| Language | Coverage | Files Translated | Files Missing | Total Files |
|----------|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| pt-br    | **88%**  | 31               | 4             | 35          |
| es-mx    | **88%**  | 31               | 4             | 35          |

Both translation directories have **identical coverage**, with the same 4 files missing from each.

## Missing Translations

### 1. README.md
**Lines**: 646  
**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH** (Main entry point)

The root README.md is the primary entry point for the project and contains:
- Project overview and core principles
- Architecture overview diagram
- Seed system explanation
- Memory model description
- FAQ section (extensive)
- Links to all other documentation

**Note**: The README.md already contains Portuguese and Spanish sections (lines 500-646), but these are embedded in the English file. The translated versions in `pt-br/README.md` and `es-mx/README.md` don't exist as standalone files.

**Impact**: New users browsing the translated directories won't find a README file to start with.

---

### 2. architecture/directry-overview.md
**Lines**: 214  
**Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** (Navigation document)

**Note**: There's a typo in the filename - should be "directory-overview.md" not "directry-overview.md"

This file serves as the architecture documentation index/navigation, containing:
- Links to all architecture documents
- Core architecture documents section
- Detailed topic documentation section
- Key architectural principles (10 principles)
- Quick reference diagrams
- Module types and event types reference
- Navigation links

**Impact**: Users navigating the translated architecture folder won't have a central index to understand the structure.

---

### 3. future-posts.md
**Lines**: 61  
**Priority**: 🟢 **LOW** (Internal/draft content)

This appears to be an **internal draft** for a LinkedIn/social media post written in Portuguese, discussing:
- Marketing strategy for ANIMA announcements
- Technical deep dive concepts
- Key architectural differentiators
- Post scheduling strategy

**Analysis**: This file seems like it was accidentally committed to the repository. It's:
- Already in Portuguese (internal draft)
- Not actual documentation
- Contains marketing/social media content
- Not referenced by any other documentation

**Recommendation**: This file should probably be:
1. Moved to a private notes folder, OR
2. Removed from the repository entirely, OR
3. If kept, moved to a `/drafts` or `/internal` folder

Translation is **not recommended** for this file.

---

### 4. specs/json_reference_system.md
**Lines**: 411  
**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH** (Technical specification)

Comprehensive technical specification for the JSON Scoped Reference System (JSRS), including:
- Overview and syntax
- Predefined scopes (`$root`, `$here`)
- Navigation logic
- User-defined namespaces
- Implementation rules
- Complex examples (3 detailed scenarios)
- Common patterns (4 patterns)
- Anti-patterns (5 anti-patterns with explanations)
- Non-goals section

**Impact**: Developers implementing or using JSRS in non-English speaking regions won't have access to this specification in their language.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Translate README.md** to both pt-br and es-mx
   - Extract and expand the existing Portuguese/Spanish sections
   - Create standalone `pt-br/README.md` and `es-mx/README.md`
   - Ensure all sections are fully translated

2. **Translate specs/json_reference_system.md**
   - Critical technical specification
   - Should be available in all supported languages
   - Contains many code examples (don't need translation, but explanatory text does)

### Medium Priority Actions

3. **Translate architecture/directry-overview.md**
   - Important for navigation
   - Consider fixing the typo in the filename first
   - Then create translations

### Low Priority / Review Needed

4. **Review future-posts.md**
   - Determine if this should remain in the repository
   - If yes, move to appropriate location (not root directory)
   - If no, remove from repository
   - Translation not recommended as it's already in Portuguese and appears to be internal content

## Translation Workflow Recommendations

### For Future Translation Work

1. **Prioritize by impact**:
   - Entry points (README files)
   - Technical specifications
   - Navigation/index files
   - Supporting documentation

2. **Maintain consistency**:
   - Both pt-br and es-mx should have identical file coverage
   - Keep directory structures synchronized
   - Update both languages simultaneously when adding new docs

3. **Quality checks**:
   - Technical terms should be translated consistently
   - Code examples should remain in English
   - URNs, schemas, and technical identifiers should not be translated
   - Links should point to translated versions when available

4. **File organization**:
   - Ensure no draft/internal files leak into the main documentation
   - Use a separate directory for drafts, notes, or work-in-progress content

---

## Technical Notes

### Files That Don't Need Translation

The following types of files don't require translation:
- Diagrams and images (`/diagrams/**`)
- `.git` directory contents
- Potentially: draft/internal files (like `future-posts.md`)

### Directory Structure Consistency

Both translation directories maintain the same structure:
```
pt-br/
├── adr/
├── annoucements/
├── architecture/
├── foundations/
├── governance/
├── roadmaps/
├── safety/
├── specs/
└── vision/

es-mx/
├── adr/
├── annoucements/
├── architecture/
├── foundations/
├── governance/
├── roadmaps/
├── safety/
├── specs/
└── vision/
```

This consistency should be maintained going forward.

---

## Conclusion

The ANIMA Engine documentation has **excellent translation coverage at 88%**. The missing translations are concentrated in 4 files, with 2 high-priority files (README.md and json_reference_system.md) that should be addressed first.

The translation infrastructure is well-organized and consistent across both supported languages. Completing these 4 remaining translations would bring the project to **100% documentation coverage** in all three languages.

## Appendix: Quick Commands

To verify translation status:

```bash
# Check for missing pt-br translations
find . -type f -name "*.md" ! -path "*/.git/*" ! -path "*/pt-br/*" ! -path "*/es-mx/*" | while read f; do
  pt_file="./pt-br/${f#./}"
  [ ! -f "$pt_file" ] && echo "Missing: $f"
done

# Check for missing es-mx translations
find . -type f -name "*.md" ! -path "*/.git/*" ! -path "*/pt-br/*" ! -path "*/es-mx/*" | while read f; do
  es_file="./es-mx/${f#./}"
  [ ! -f "$es_file" ] && echo "Missing: $f"
done
```
