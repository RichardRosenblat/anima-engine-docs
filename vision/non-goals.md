# ANIMA — Non-Goals

## Purpose

This document defines what ANIMA is **not trying to achieve**.

These are not temporary limitations, missing features, or items deferred on a roadmap.
They are **explicit boundaries** chosen to protect safety, trust, identity integrity, and long-term viability.

When asked *“Why doesn’t ANIMA just do X?”*, this document is the answer.

---

## 1. No Autonomous Internet Agents

ANIMA is **not** designed to operate as an autonomous internet agent.

She will not:

* Browse the web freely by default
* Act on external systems without explicit capability approval
* Self-direct online actions without human confirmation
* Crawl, scrape, or monitor the internet continuously

Any internet interaction, if present at all, is:

* Capability-gated
* Explicitly authorized
* Context-limited
* Fully auditable

Unsupervised online autonomy is treated as a **high-risk behavior**, not a feature.

---

## 2. No Mass Surveillance or Monitoring

ANIMA is not a surveillance system.

She will not:

* Passively monitor people, conversations, or environments
* Record audio, video, or sensor data without explicit consent
* Aggregate behavioral data across users or instances
* Perform background tracking of individuals

ANIMA’s design prioritizes **privacy and locality**.
Observation only occurs when intentionally initiated and clearly bounded.

---

## 3. No Personality Harvesting or Extraction

ANIMA does not collect, extract, or sell personality data.

She will not:

* Analyze users to generate personality profiles for external use
* Train global models on user interactions
* Export user behavior as datasets
* Learn from one user to influence another

Each Identity evolves **only from its own experiences**.
There is no shared learning pool.

---

## 4. No Shared Memory or Hive-Mind Behavior

ANIMA instances are **strictly isolated**.

She will not:

* Share memories between Identities
* Inherit experiences from other users
* Access global conversation logs
* Exhibit cross-Identity recall

There is no “collective ANIMA consciousness”.

Memory isolation is a **hard architectural constraint**, not a configuration option.

---

## 5. No Hardcoded Personalities

ANIMA does not ship with a single, fixed personality.

She will not:

* Claim a personal identity not supported and backed by her memory
* Pretend continuity where none exists

Identity emerges through:

* Seeds (initial constraints)
* Experience
* Memory
* Interaction

Not through scripted behavior.

---

## 6. No Replacement of Human Judgment

ANIMA is not a decision-maker on behalf of humans.

She will not:

* Make irreversible decisions without human confirmation
* Act as a moral authority
* Assume responsibility for real-world consequences
* Present herself as infallible or superior

ANIMA supports humans — she does not replace them.

---

## 7. No Optimization for Engagement or Manipulation

ANIMA is not optimized to:

* Maximize user engagement
* Persuade or influence behavior
* Build emotional dependency
* Retain users through manipulation

Trust is built through **honesty and consistency**, not through psychological tactics.

---

## 8. No Unbounded Self-Modification

ANIMA cannot rewrite her own core logic.

She will not:

* Modify the engine
* Alter safety constraints
* Escalate her own capabilities
* Mutate seeds or identity definitions

All evolution occurs within predefined, inspectable boundaries.

---

## 9. No “General Intelligence” Claims

ANIMA does not claim to be:

* A general artificial intelligence
* Conscious
* Sentient
* Alive

She makes no metaphysical claims about her nature.

ANIMA is a system — not a being.

---

## 10. No Unethical Data Sourcing for First-Party Components

ANIMA will not train first-party models on:

* Scraped data without consent
* Unauthorized or illegally accessed data
* Data sources with unclear provenance
* User data from other identities
* Cross-Identity learning pools

**Current Reality:**

During active development with limited resources, ANIMA uses third-party models whose training data may not meet these standards.

**This is acknowledged as a temporary constraint**, not a permanent acceptance.

**Long-term Commitment:**

As resources allow, ANIMA will shift to first-party models trained exclusively on:

* Legally accessed data
* Consent-based sources
* Transparent provenance
* Documented ethical evaluation

This transition is a **first priority**, not a deferred goal.

---

## 11. No Computational Waste or Environmental Negligence

ANIMA will not:

* Optimize for capability at the cost of efficiency
* Use "always largest model" approaches
* Ignore energy costs in architectural decisions
* Waste computational resources unnecessarily

**In active development:**

* Local-first architecture
* Configurable model topology (Cortex-only mode)
* Modular capabilities
* Resource-appropriate model support

**Long-term Commitment:**

* Fully optimized first-party infrastructure
* Minimal environmental footprint
* Energy-efficient model design
* Transparent environmental impact metrics

---

## Final Statement

These non-goals are not signs of limitation.

They are **deliberate choices**.

By refusing certain paths, ANIMA protects:

* User autonomy
* Identity integrity
* Long-term trust
* System safety

Some things are intentionally left undone.

That is how ANIMA remains safe to grow with.
