# LICENSING_MODEL.md

## Purpose

This document explains **how ANIMA is licensed**, what is exchanged, and what is explicitly *not* claimed.

The licensing model exists to:

* enable sustainable development
* enforce capability boundaries
* protect user ownership of identity and memory

It is not designed to control behavior, extract data, or lock users in.

---

## What Is Sold

When you acquire an ANIMA license, you are **not buying an AI personality**.

You are granted:

### 1. Execution Rights

The right to run the ANIMA engine under defined conditions.

This includes:

* Access to engine updates
* Bug fixes and safety improvements
* Compatibility with supported models

Execution rights are **time-bound or tier-bound**, not perpetual ownership of binaries.

---

### 2. Capability Access

Licenses may enable:

* Specific capability modules
* Higher-risk execution paths
* Increased task concurrency
* Expanded adapter support

Capabilities are:

* Explicit
* Discoverable
* Enforced at runtime

A license **never grants unlimited power** — it only whitelists certain actions.

---

### 3. Seeds

Some licenses include:

* Official identity seeds
* Curated starting profiles
* Seed updates and revisions

Seeds are:

* Data, not code
* Versioned
* Cryptographically signed

A seed grants a **starting configuration**, not a permanent personality.

---

## What Is Not Sold

### 1. User Memory

ANIMA does **not** claim ownership over:

* Conversation history
* Instance-local memory
* Narrative development
* Preferences or relationships

Memory belongs to the **instance owner**.

Licensing does not grant:

* Memory access
* Memory reuse
* Memory aggregation
* Training rights

---

### 2. Identity Ownership

ANIMA does not assert ownership over:

* Emergent personality
* Long-term identity evolution
* User-created seeds or derivatives

What grows inside an instance:

> belongs to that instance’s owner.

---

### 3. User Data

ANIMA does not require:

* Centralized memory storage
* Cloud-only operation
* Data submission for licensing validation

---

## Offline Behavior

ANIMA is designed to function **offline**.

When offline:

* Existing memories remain accessible
* Previously unlocked capabilities remain available (within policy)
* No new license verification occurs

If a license expires:

* ANIMA does not erase memory
* ANIMA does not lock the user out
* ANIMA degrades gracefully (e.g. capability reduction)

There is no “kill switch”.

---

## Why This Is Not DRM

Traditional DRM:

* Restricts access to owned content
* Assumes hostile users
* Punishes legitimate use
* Obscures enforcement

ANIMA’s licensing model:

* Controls **execution pathways**, not content
* Treats users as operators, not adversaries
* Is transparent and auditable
* Never holds memory hostage

Licensing gates **what the engine is allowed to do**, not what the user owns.

---

## Capability Gating vs Ownership

A useful distinction:

* **Ownership** → memory, identity, instance evolution
* **Licensing** → execution rights, capability exposure

These concerns are deliberately separated.

ANIMA enforces this separation at the architectural level.

---

## Failure Modes

If licensing systems fail:

* Memory remains intact
* Instances remain readable
* Safety defaults activate
* No data is deleted

Loss of license never results in loss of identity.

---

## Summary

ANIMA’s licensing model exists to:

* Sustain development
* Enforce safety boundaries
* Enable modular capability access

It does **not** exist to:

* Extract user data
* Control identity evolution
* Impose artificial scarcity
* Replace ownership with permission

You do not rent your ANIMA’s memories.

You license **how the engine may act**.
